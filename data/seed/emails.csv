Transmission investment plans increased by 15% YoY. Utility rate cases remain a watch item with regulatory approvals pending in three key jurisdictions. Natural gas storage levels are above historical averages which may pressure power pricing in Q1. Key takeaway: Grid modernization investments are accelerating faster than expected."

5,portfolio-co@company.com,"Covenant Compliance Report","Attached is our Q4 2024 covenant compliance certificate. All financial covenants are in compliance: Debt/EBITDA at 4.2x (threshold 5.0x), Fixed Charge Coverage at 1.4x (threshold 1.25x), and minimum liquidity at $15M (threshold $10M). We anticipate covenant headroom to tighten in Q1 due to seasonal working capital needs but expect to remain compliant."
